# Sentence-Processor-Web-Application

This repository contains a web application that allows users to input a sentence and utilizes promises and the fetch API to send the sentence to a mock server for processing. The application demonstrates the power of promises and the fetch method in handling asynchronous operations and implements a response handling mechanism to display the processed data asynchronously.

Features:
- User Input: Users can enter a sentence in the input field provided on the web page.
- Promise-based Fetch: The application uses promises and the fetch API to send the sentence to a server for processing.
- Asynchronous Processing: The server processes the sentence asynchronously and returns the processed data.
- Response Handling: The application implements a response handling mechanism that displays the processed data asynchronously on the web page.
- User-friendly Interface: The web application provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

Tech Stack:
- HTML: The structure and layout of the web page are defined using HTML.
- CSS: Styling and visual enhancements are applied using CSS.
- JavaScript: The core functionality of the application, including promises, fetch API, and response handling, is implemented using JavaScript.
